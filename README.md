# Timestamp Microservice & Request Header Parser Microservice

The provided Node.js code serves as a backend API for handling date-related requests. The application utilizes the Express.js framework to create various endpoints. The `/api/hello` endpoint responds with a simple greeting in JSON format. The `/api/whoami` endpoint provides information about the client's IP address, preferred language, and user-agent software.

The `/api/` endpoint returns the current UTC timestamp and Unix timestamp. Additionally, there is a dynamic route `/api/:date` that accepts a date parameter. It checks whether the provided date is convertible to a valid date using the `isConvertibleToDate` function and, if so, responds with the Unix and UTC representations of that date. If the date is in milliseconds, the application converts it and returns the corresponding UTC timestamp. If the date is invalid, an error message is returned.

The `helper.js` file exports two functions used by the main application. The `isConvertibleToDate` function checks if a given text can be parsed into a valid date, while the `isMilliseconds` function checks if the text represents a time in milliseconds.

For deployment, the application is dockerized, allowing it to run consistently across different environments. Kubernetes deployment files, such as `deployment.yaml` and `service.yaml`, are created to manage the deployment, scaling, and exposure of the application within a Kubernetes cluster. The Docker image is pushed to Docker Hub, and the Kubernetes cluster is configured to pull and run the image. The deployment is then accessible through the defined service, making the API available for use.

This project was part of the Back End Development and APIs certification on FreeCodeCamp.
